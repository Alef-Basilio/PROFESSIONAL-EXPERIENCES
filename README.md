Cybermissions</br>

</br></br>
• JavaScript, Sass, Gulp.js, Git, HTML and CSS.</br>
• Cybermissions is a Virginia (USA) non-profit organization that provides training and religious
content for underprivileged people.</br>
• I update the organization's websites weekly: the interfaces, functionalities and server.</br>
• Leadership: although it was my first professional experience, I needed to define work
methodologies with other people. To do this, I used knowledge acquired in courses with more
experienced programmers.
